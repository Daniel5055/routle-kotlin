## Routle

This is a web version of the Escaper game I created for the 2022 STACS Hackton. It is a fullstack project written completely in Kotlin. The frontend is Kotlin/Js, the backend is Kotlin/Jvm, and the build system is 
Gradle/kotlin.

I used the Ktor framework for backend routing, and Kotlin Doodle for creating the frontend UI.
